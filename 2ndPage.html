Make a table to hold the different ways and when a loop is useful

<h1>More about Loops in C++</h1>
<p>See the table below on how and when each type of loop should be used.</p>
<table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Loop Type</th>
		<th>When to Use</th>
		<th>Example</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>for</td>
		<td>When you know the exact number of iterations needed.</td>
		<td>
                    <pre><code>for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // code to be executed
}</code></pre>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>while</td>
		<td>When the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.</td>
		<td>
                    <pre><code>while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}</code></pre>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>do-while</td>
		<td>When you need to execute the code block at least once, regardless of the condition.</td>
		<td>
                    <pre><code>do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);</code></pre>
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


<p>
	Now that you know a when to use each type of loop, go on to the next section and try the practice problems.
	If you still feel uncomfortable please go back a page and reread.
