Description: This webpage is for a small section that would be in a
            how to learn c++ book. I always wondered what it would be
            like to try and code a book online so here it is. -->

<h1>Loops in C++</h1>

<!-- Section for For Loop -->
<section>
	<h2>For loops</h2>
	<p>
		For loops are specifically used when you want to go through a loop and have a
		good idea of how many iterations you will need. The for loop consists of the
		following parts: the initialization, the condition, and the changer of the variable.

		<h6>This is a For loop example code.</h6>
	</div>
</section>

<!-- Section for While Loop -->
<section>
	<h2>While loops</h2>
	<p>
		While loops are used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition.
	</p>
	<div class="image-container">

		<h6>This is a while loop example code.</h6>
	</div>
</section>

<!-- Section for Do-While Loop -->
<section>
	<h2>Do-While loops</h2>
	<p>
		Do-While loops are similar to while loops, but they guarantee that the code block will be executed at least once.
