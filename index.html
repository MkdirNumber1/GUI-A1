Description: This webpage is for a small section that would be in a
            how to learn c++ book. I always wondered what it would be
            like to try and code a book online so here it is.
            Approval for fair use. -->

	<h2>For loops</h2>
	<p>
		For loops are ideal when you know in advance how many
		times you need to execute a block of code.
		They are structured to include an initialization step, a condition check,
		and an increment/decrement operation.
		This makes them particularly useful for iterating over arrays or collections
		where the number of elements is known.

<!-- Section for While Loop -->
<section>
	<h2>While loops</h2>
	<p>
		While loops are used when the number of iterations is not predetermined.
		Instead, the loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition remains true.
		This makes while loops suitable for scenarios where the loopâ€™s execution depends on
		dynamic conditions, such as user input or the state of a program.

<!-- Section for Do-While Loop -->
<section>
	<h2>Do-While loops</h2>
	<p>
		Do-While loops are similar to while loops but with a key difference: the code block
		inside a do-while loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. This is
		because the condition is evaluated after the code block has been executed.
